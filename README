  Creating a user area in the CMSSW repository
  --------------------------------------------

  There is an area called "UserCode" in the CMSSW repository where you can
create yourself a package to store your code and cfg files, for example:

   UserCode/PElmer

Note that this area is primarily intended for "user" code which will never
go into CMSSW software releases. If you intend for your code to go into 
CMSSW releases, you should probably just request a normal package with the 
normal procedure via the Tag Collector.

  To create such a user CVS area for yourself, do the following:

    1) Choose a packagename for yourself. Typically this should be your
       name (e.g. with some capitalization as above, or your CERN unix 
       username, etc.) so that it is semi-obvious whose package it is.
  
    2) Then create your package (here for an example "JohnDoe" user):
  
         (set your CVSROOT to point to the CMSSW CVS repository)
         ('cd' to some temporary area)
         cvs co UserCode/README
         mkdir UserCode/JohnDoe
         cd UserCode
         cvs add JohnDoe
  
      In general it is advisable to structure it like a normal CMSSW package,
      i.e. with the same subdirectory structure. To do this, you can do:
  
         mkdir JohnDoe/src JohnDoe/interface
         cvs add JohnDoe/src JohnDoe/interface
         mkdir JohnDoe/data JohnDoe/test
         cvs add JohnDoe/data JohnDoe/test
 
      If you do not think you need some of these subdirectories at the
      moment, you simply do not 'mkdir' and 'cvs add' them.
 
    3) Then you can 'cd' into the "src" area of some scram working/developer
       area and do:
  
         cvs co UserCode/JohnDoe
  
      and begin to add your code and cfg files to the subdirectories. If you 
      need a BuildFile, you can copy an example from a normal CMSSW package 
      and edit it to serve your purposes.
  
      *********************************************************************
      ** Please note that you should _not_ commit files to the UserCode  **
      ** directory itself, but only in your equivalent of the "JohnDoe"  **
      ** sub-directory....                                               **
      *********************************************************************

** To add the files in the USerCode area, Do :
1.) Add the file in the area where you want to add
add myPlot.C psaxena/scripts/myPlot.C

2.) cvs commit psaxena/scripts/myPlot.C
